## 🔧 Planned Performance Optimizations

### Client-Side Image Caching and Compression
- **Cookie-Based Image Compression Strategy**
  - Store compressed thumbnail versions of game images in cookies
  - Implement progressive quality loading for images (low quality first, then high)
  - Automatically purge older images when cache limit is reached
  - Use a hashing mechanism to ensure image uniqueness and reduce storage size

- **Implementation Plan**
  - Create an `ImageCacheService` to handle image processing and compression
  - Develop a `compressImage` utility using canvas to reduce image size
  - Build a cookie manager to store and retrieve cached images efficiently
  - Implement a custom React hook for seamless integration in components

### Additional Server Load Reduction Techniques
- **Game Data Caching**
  - Store category and popular game data in localStorage
  - Implement a TTL (Time-To-Live) mechanism for cache invalidation
  - Add version control to invalidate cache when data structure changes
  - Reduce API calls by implementing stale-while-revalidate pattern

- **On-Demand Asset Loading**
  - Lazy load game assets only when visible in viewport
  - Pre-fetch game data for categories currently being viewed
  - Prioritize loading essential UI elements before decorative content
  - Implement resource hints (preconnect, prefetch) for common resources

- **Static Asset Optimization**
  - Leverage browser cache with proper cache headers
  - Implement service worker for offline game access where possible
  - Use CDN for high-traffic static assets
  - Optimize image formats (WebP with PNG fallback)

- **Network Optimization**
  - Implement request batching for multiple related API calls
  - Use HTTP/2 to reduce connection overhead
  - Compress API responses with gzip/brotli
  - Minimize payload sizes through selective data loading

This multi-faceted approach will significantly reduce server load while improving the user experience through faster loading times and reduced bandwidth consumption.
